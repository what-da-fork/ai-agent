Extending the Project

You've done all the required steps, but have some fun (but carefully... be very cautious about giving an LLM access to your filesystem and python interpreter) with it! See if you can get it to:

    Fix harder and more complex bugs
    Refactor sections of code
    Add entirely new features

You can also try:

    Other LLM providers
    Other Gemini models
    Giving it more functions to call
    Other codebases (Commit your changes before running the agent so you can always revert!)

Remember, what we've built is a toy version of something like Cursor/Zed's Agentic Mode, or Claude Code. Even their tools aren't perfectly secure, so be careful what you give it access to, and don't give this code away to anyone else to use.
